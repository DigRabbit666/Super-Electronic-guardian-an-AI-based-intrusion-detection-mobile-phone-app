# Sketch
For security reasons of illegal entry in daily life, such as whether there are illegal intruders entering the house from the doors and windows, whether the incapacitated people (children or elder) entering the kitchen, balcony and other dangerous areas. In the meantime, installation of surveillance cameras is impossible, such as the rented house or travelling outside. AI mobile app for such a situation is developed. Android Studio, Tencent's deep learning inference engine NCNN and my own night vision algorithm Opt2Ada are used.

The deployed AI algorithm can achieve: 1. Identify the human shape target in certain area by the mobile phone’s camera; 2. Enhance the brightness of captured images to enable the detection in the low light condition. When the app detects the human shape target, it will release the voice alarm and vibration prompt to remind the user that someone is present in the target area.
